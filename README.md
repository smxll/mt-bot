You also need to have mozilla geckodriver you can get it here ![geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver).

If you wish to use some other browser binary supported by selenium (i.e. Chrome), you need to edit 'Bot.py'.

replace :

`self.driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=self.options)` 

with something like :

`self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=self.options)`

Make sure you have geckodriver binary (or any other browser) in project directory or you might want to specify the path in `Bot.py`.

E.g. `self.driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path="/data/Drivers/geckodriver",options=self.options)`
